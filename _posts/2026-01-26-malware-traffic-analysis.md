## 🛡 Case Overview  
A packet capture file (**2021-09-14.pcap**) containing **3,679 packets** was analyzed following reports that an endpoint device may have downloaded malware. The objective of this analysis was to identify suspicious network activity and extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Kali Linux  
- tcpdump  
- WHOIS lookup  
- VirusTotal  

## Step 1 — Opening the Capture File

tcpdump -r 2021-09-14.pcap


To determine the size of the capture:
tcpdump -r 2021-09-14.pcap --count


**Result:** The capture contained **3,679 packets**.

## Step 2 — Filtering for Web Traffic

tcpdump -r 2021-09-14.pcap -A tcp port 80 | egrep "GET|POST"


## Step 3 — Suspicious HTTP Request Identified

- **Source IP:** 10.0.0.168  
- **Destination IP:** 103.232.55.148

## Step 4 — OSINT Investigation

The destination IP address was investigated:

- WHOIS lookup indicates infrastructure located in **Vietnam**

- VirusTotal flagged the IP as suspicious

## Step 5 — File Download Observed

The endpoint attempted to download:
.audiodg.exe



This is concerning due to the executable format and suspicious naming.

## 🚨 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| Type | Value |
|------|-------|
| Malicious IP | 103.232.55.148 |
| Suspicious File | .audiodg.exe |
| Affected Host | 10.0.0.168 |

## 🔍 Conclusion

The analysis identified outbound HTTP communication from an internal host to a suspicious external server, resulting in the download of a potentially malicious executable file. Findings support escalation for host isolation and further incident response actions.
