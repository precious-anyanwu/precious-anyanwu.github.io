## 📡 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical network packet capture and TCP traffic analysis performed in a local lab environment using Kali Linux. The objective was to observe how systems communicate over TCP and understand how the three-way handshake establishes reliable connections.

The lab involved setting up a local HTTP server and monitoring traffic between a client and server using packet capture tools.
