## 👋 Welcome

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a focused interest in **Security Operations (SOC)** and **Cloud Security**. I have a technical background in telecoms Radio Access Network (RAN) operations and data annotation for machine learning workflows.

My experience includes network monitoring, fault analysis, infrastructure awareness, and structured data labeling with strong attention to detail. I am currently building hands-on projects in Linux security, SOC-style email and log analysis, and AWS security configurations.

This site documents my learning journey, practical labs, and security-focused projects as I prepare for entry-level and junior SOC or Cloud Security roles.
